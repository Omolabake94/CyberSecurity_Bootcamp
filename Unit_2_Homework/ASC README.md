# Assessing Security Culture
***
### Measure and Set Goals
(1) Indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices.
* Phishing email/Exposed Emails: Employees who check work email on personal devices often fail to use basic security measures. If accessed, their email accounts or social media apps may provide easy information. Employees receive malicious emails which can be difficult to differentiate and when links or attachments are opened, it can lead to exposed company data.
* Unsecure network: Employees can access work information with unsecure internet networks, such as those in public spaces like airports and cafes, are often targeted by attacks. Hackers can intercept traffic coming to and from an employee’s device and use it to infiltrate the company’s system
* Malware: Employees can access whatever sites or download any mobile apps that a company network would normally restrict to protect their system. Jailbreaking or rooting a device also puts company's data at risk because it removes limitations imposed by the manufacturer to keep the mobile software updated and protected against external threats, which definitely gives easy access to malware attack.
* Lost or sstolen devices: Device lost or stolen can be infiltrated and mined for personally-identifiable information. An organization’s reputation can be severely damaged if a security breach through an employee’s device leads to a leak of crucial information on a customers or business partners. That means possibly dealing with litigation from different parties.

(2) What are the preferred employee behavior?
* Encryption of data and avoid downloading opening malicious emails
* Employees should keep personal and work-related interactions separate, ideally using completely different apps for each type of contact.
* Employees should make use of company VPN connection, a private Wi-Fi connection or a tethered mobile phone network. Each of these secure network options offers better protection
* Employees should avoid jailbreaking or rooting their device (installing unapproved apps or making unauthorized customizations). This opens up new vulnerabilities by bypassing built-in security features.
* Employees should keep their operating systems well updated and protect all of their devices with passcode or fingerprint recognition. The more obstacles a potential thief faces, the greater chance your company’s data remains protected.

(3) Methods to use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?
* Penetration testing: Have pentester to run a phishing campaign against the company and keep track of employees who download them.
* Monitoring Tools: Use of Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) which contains Mobile Device Management (MDM), Mobile Content Management (MCM), Mobile Application Management (MAM) solutions and user profiling while offering full endpoint security. This keeps track of employees' activities on their devices
* Efficiency: Measuring of Employee productivity, the quality and quantity of tasks performed per day or per week. Emloyee that has not been engaging in the right security behavior will have issues being productive due to device malfunction. Malfunction can occur with constant exposure of devices to malware and other possible attacks 
* Employee Survey: Use of feedback and comments of co-workers

(4) What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?
* Based on the above scenario, about 75% of Employees at silverCorp use their personal devices for company work. Assuming 25-30% of employees are not practicing the right behavior. the goal is to reduce that to about 10% and gradually move down to the most possible minimum.

###  Involve the Right People.
* Finance: They are responsible for minitoring company's finances. They will be responsible for budgeting and allocation of funds for the training.

* COO:

* CISO: They will be respnsible for developing and disseminating training to to employees. Also developing and disseminating information security policies

* HR manager: They help in scheduling trainings, and tracking attendance. They are also responsible for ensuring that employees comply with security policies that are designed to protect the company, clients and workforce

* Internal Communication:They responsible for effective communication of the training to the ecmployess. They deliver messages and campaigns on behalf of management, to facilitating two-way dialogue between management and employee


### Training Plan
##### How frequently will you run training? 
* When new exployees join the team
* After an incident occurs
* Every 3 months intervals throughout the year

##### What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)
* Training will be both in-person and online for new employees and after an incident occur. 3 months interval training will be online only 

##### What topics will you cover in your training and why? 
* Public Wi-Fi Risks and Solutions: Public networks can pose a substantial risk to information security and information confidentiality. Attackers can easily intercept data transferred to public networks using ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacks. If a network is not secure, the chances of it being safe to use are very low. If employees absolutely have to make use of public Wi-Fi networks when working remotely, ensure that the organization has a VPN solution in place. This will allow users to transfer data securely through an encryption tunnel

* Password security best practices: A lot of people struggle to remember their password credentials thereby leading to using one password across multiple accounts (email, laptops, office desktops, tablets, applications, and databases). As password databases are continuously being attacked using more and more sophisticated algorithms in bruteforce or dictionary attacks and password spraying, it is advisable to use a unique password for each device or account. Also training on the use of 2 factor authentication where possible for their accounts

* Dangers of Malware, how it spreads and how to avoid them: Malware can come in many forms, including spyware (collects sensitive information), adware (clogs your device up with advertisements), and ransomware (taking data hostage in exchange for ransom usually received in the form of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin). Malicious software can make its way into computer systems or devices and into networks via phishing emails. By clicking on suspicious links, users can be directed to insecure websites. Opening malicious files and attachments can do untold damage to systems and data. 

* Secure Access to Mobile Devices and Remote Wiping Features: Many employees are able to access their business email or other office applications via their smart devices. With so much sensitive and confidential information held in these devices, the potential for unauthorized access can be a big cyber security threat, inside and outside the office. Where employees are dealing with highly confidential company or client information, using remote wiping features is highly considered in the unfortunate (but plausible) case of a lost or stolen device.

##### After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?
* Few months after traning, monitoring tools can be used to check on employees activities to see if they are still not behaving according to the preferred behavior. Employees' efficiency should be compared again previous efficiency. Phishing campaign should be done to determine the amount of employees that clicks on them. The target is to reduce it to about 10% of employees and with continous training, to get it as low possible


## Other potential Solutions are
***
#### Exposed Emails
