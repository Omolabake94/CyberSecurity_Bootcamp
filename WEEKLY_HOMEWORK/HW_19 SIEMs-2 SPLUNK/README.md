#### Global Mitigations
1. Use Strong Passwords. Strong password policies should be put in place; ensure users are not allowed to use their names as passwords and passwords should not less that 8 characters which should include numbers and special characters
2. Restrict Access to Authentication URLs: 
3. Limit Login Attempts 
4. Use of CAPTCHAs on website
5. Use of Two-Factor Authentication to verify user before login and multi-factor authentication to verify user identity before allowing password changes
6. Putting your website behind a web application firewall
7. Increase lockout time after every lockout and after 2 lockouts their accounts would have to be manually unlocked by the IT Department

There were several attempts made to reset User k accounts password. The total of 2012 attempts were made. As shown in the screenshot below
